## Application
Our application is based on the game "MasterMind". 

## [Classic MasterMind Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
This game aims to guess the correct sequence of colors in 4 positions. We will have two players, one player guess and one player provide the colors and the positions of the 4 pegs. For example, the answer could be blue, red, yellow, green and the player needs to guess both the color and the order correctly. There will be 6 colors available. The guesser will guess 10 rounds and each round the player would know extra information about the answer based on the current guess.

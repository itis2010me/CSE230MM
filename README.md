# CSE230MM
F2022 CSE 230 final project

## Application
Our application is based on the game "MasterMind". 

## [Classic MasterMind Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
This game aims to guess the correct sequence of colors in 4 positions. We will have two players, one player guess and one player provide the colors and the positions of the 4 pegs. For example, the answer could be blue, red, yellow, green and the player needs to guess both the color and the order correctly. There will be 6 colors available. The guesser will guess 10 rounds and each round the player would know extra information about the answer based on the current guess.

## Goals
### G1
- Basic TUI setup as well as basic game state logic. 
- Implementation for 1 Player game mode.

### G2
- Implementation for 2 Players game mode.

### G3 (Milestone 3)
- TUI optimization with colored pegs.
- TUI navigation and control optimizations.

### G4
- Implementation for the AI player game mode.
- Implementation for variable game settings.
    - Players are allowed to change the followings:
        - Number of rounds
        - Possible peg colors (minimum 2)
        - Allow/disallow duplicate pins in hidden pegs.
